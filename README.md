### hello :)

A lifelong passion for technology and programming has led me to develop a diverse skill set in a wide range of languages, frameworks, and tools, including C#, PHP, Python, Go, Rust, and C/C++. My current focus is on the JavaScript ecosystem, where I build interactive web solutions.

As a Frontend Developer at Americanas, a leading Brazilian e-commerce company, I'm leading the development of a new site using Next.js, GraphQL, Fastify, and TypeScript to enhance user experience and performance. This modern application integrates with various microservices and APIs. Previously as a Backend Developer, I successfully migrated all services from Ansible to Metaplane, gaining valuable visibility into AWS pods, metrics, logs, and costs. I also implemented key features and provided maintenance for projects in various Java versions.
