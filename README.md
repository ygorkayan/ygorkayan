### Speak People :)

With a passion for technology and programming since I was young, I have developed a diverse and extensive skill set in various languages, frameworks, and tools, such as C#, PHP, Python, Go, Rust, and C/C++. However, my focus today is on the JavaScript ecosystem, creating interactive and dynamic web solutions that solve real-world problems.

As a frontend developer at americanas, one of the largest e-commerce companies in Brazil, I am building a new site from scratch to enhance the user experience and performance. I am using Next.js, GraphQL, Fastify, and TypeScript to create a modern and scalable web application that integrates with various microservices and APIs. In my previous role as a back end developer at the same company, I migrated all our services from Ansible to Metaplane, a platform that provides visibility, metrics, logs, and cost control for our pods in AWS. I also implemented new features and maintained projects in different versions of Java. I have a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Universidade Estácio de Sá, and multiple certifications in programming logic, information and communication technology, and object-oriented programming. I am fluent in Portuguese and know English, and always eager to learn new things and improve my skills.
